Social Mail (Soil)

*Soil* is a mailing lists manager; it is also a social network based on email. Email itself is a social network! Soil innovates on the concept of mailing lists. We could say that it is a 'mail application', in contraposition to web applications. Nonetheless it is built over Rails, so it has a web front-end too.
